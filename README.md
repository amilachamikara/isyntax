Natural Language Interface for Databases

In modern environment the databases has become a strong point of advantage in any field. This is because most of the systems are now computerized. But to handle these systems there needs to be special knowladge and education. These systems enables us to store and retrive necessery data without any hassle. But most of the organizations tend to recruit more people due to the necessity of the technica knowladge.

We are suggesting a system which takes a scenario and formulates the database and normalize it accordingly. The System can create or query databases. Then the database can be quarried using natural language text or in a graphical query method which has its own predefined symbols. Here we believe that we can use any database which has the nomenclature in natural language. The database Creation will use a rule based approach for creating databases based on the syntaxes. The database normalization will take the created databased and normalized it with extracting functional dependencies from the given user case study. Natural Language querying will be done based on analyzing both syntaxes and semantics of the question. The Graphical querying will explore the methods of representing the SQL in a query language.
