Every airplane has a registration number, and a model.
The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model has a unique model number, a capacity and a weight.
A number of technicians work at the airport. You need to store each technician's name, SSN, address, phone number, and salary.
Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians.
This information about technicians must also be recorded.
Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, you must store the date of the most recent exam.
All airport employees (including technicians) belong to a union and each employee has a union membership number.
You can assume that each employee is uniquely identified by a social security number.
The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy.
Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.
The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test.
For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and
the score the airplane received on the test.
