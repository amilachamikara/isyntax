A "booking" is an event in which a certain band plays in a particular club on a particular date, starting at a certain time, ending at a certain time, and for a specific fee.
A band can play more than once a day.
For each booking, the club pays the talent agent, who keeps a five percent fee and then gives the rest to the band.
Each band has at least two members.
Each band has a desired fee.
The agent notes a telephone number of just one band member, which is used as the band's contact number.
The agent keeps track of just one instrument that each band member plays.
Each nightclub has a name, an address, and a contact person.
That contact person has a telephone number that the agent uses to contact the club.
Each nightclub has a target maximum fee.
The contact person will try to get the agent to accept that amount for a band's appearance.
Some clubs will feed the band members for free, and others will not.
