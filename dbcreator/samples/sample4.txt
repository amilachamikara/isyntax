Reviews by reviewers are recorded for use in the paper selection process.
The database system caters primarily to reviewers who record answers to evaluation questions for each paper they review
and make recommendations regarding whether to accept or reject the paper.
Authors of papers are uniquely identified by e-mail id. Authors' first name and last name are also recorded.
Each paper has a unique identifier and it is described by a title, abstract, and the name of the electronic file.
A paper may have multiple authors, but one is designated as the contact author.
Reviewers of papers are uniquely identified by e-mail address.
Each reviewer's first name, last name, phone number, affiliation, and topics of interest are also recorded.
Each paper is assigned between two and four reviewers.
A reviewer rates each paper assigned to him or her on a scale of 1 to 10 in four categories.
